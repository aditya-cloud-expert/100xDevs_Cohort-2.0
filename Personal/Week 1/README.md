How to Solve JavaScript Assignments in the Cohort 2.0 ?

=>  You are provided empty JavaScript files (or having function signatures) in this directory. 
    You have to follow the instructions given in each file and write the code in the same file to complete the assignment.

    ### Assignments
    Feel free to start doing these in any order you like.
    1. Easy
    2. Medium
    3. Hard

    ## Testing
    1. Follow the comment above each problem to run test for that problem
    3. To tests for all the problems of this week run ```npx jest ./tests/```

    #### Development Setup
    1. If you have Node.js locally, you should run these on your machine 
    2. If you don't, you can copy these over to repl.it and run it there. Tests wont be automated there so you will have to make use judgement to ensure if your code is correct


Interpreted Vs Compiled Languages;
=> Javascript is interpreted Language , because it is not compiled. While C++ is compiled language , because it is we have to compile it before we can run it. 

Repl.it is a platform where you can run your code.

Javascript is Single Threaded Language. Which means it is executed on a single core. This is why JS is bad Language for Scaleable application. But there is a way to make JS use all the cores. Which is called Cluster-Module.

Context Switching is possible in Javascript just like other applications. 

Functions can take other fucntions as an input. This is called as Callbacks.
